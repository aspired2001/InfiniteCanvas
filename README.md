## Components

### Whiteboard

The main drawing component that provides a canvas for users to create and manipulate various shapes and drawings. See [Whiteboard.md](./docs/Whiteboard.md) for detailed documentation.

### Toolbar

A component that provides controls for selecting drawing tools and customizing drawing properties.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the application
- **Fabric.js**: Canvas manipulation library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **shadcn/ui**: UI component library

## Development

### Key Concepts

- **Canvas Persistence**: The canvas state is preserved when switching between tools
- **Tool Management**: Each tool has its own event handlers for mouse interactions
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts to the window size

### Best Practices

- Use the provided tools for drawing and manipulation
- Avoid clearing the canvas unnecessarily
- Use the selection tool to modify existing objects
